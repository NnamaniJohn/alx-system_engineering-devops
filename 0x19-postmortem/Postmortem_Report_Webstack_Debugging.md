## Web Stack Outage Postmortem: Database Connectivity Issue

# Issue Summary:
Duration: May 15, 2023, 10:00 AM - May 15, 2023, 11:30 AM (UTC)
Impact: Database service was unavailable, causing slow response times and errors for all users. 75% of users experienced disruptions during the outage.

# Timeline:

10:00 AM: The issue was detected when monitoring systems alerted a high number of database connection failures.
10:05 AM: The operations team started investigating the problem and noticed the slow response times and intermittent errors reported by users.
10:10 AM: Initial assumption was a network connectivity issue, so network logs and configurations were analyzed.
10:20 AM: Network connectivity issue was ruled out after thorough investigation.
10:30 AM: Attention shifted to the database cluster as multiple instances were showing abnormal behavior.
10:45 AM: Initial suspicion pointed towards a recent software update applied to the database cluster, and rollback procedures were considered.
11:00 AM: Incident was escalated to the database administration team and the development team responsible for the recent software update.
11:15 AM: Database administrators identified the root cause as a misconfigured database connection pool causing resource exhaustion.
11:30 AM: The incident was resolved by reconfiguring the connection pool settings and restarting the affected services.
#Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was a misconfigured database connection pool that allowed more connections to be opened simultaneously than the database server could handle. As a result, the database server became overwhelmed and unable to serve incoming requests, causing slow response times and errors.

To resolve the issue, the database connection pool settings were adjusted to limit the maximum number of concurrent connections. This prevented the database server from becoming overloaded. The affected services were restarted to apply the new configuration, restoring normal database connectivity.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improve configuration management practices to ensure proper review and testing of software updates before deployment.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect abnormal database behavior and connection pool exhaustion.
Implement automated alerts to promptly notify the operations team of any database connectivity issues.
Conduct regular capacity planning to estimate future resource requirements and avoid resource exhaustion scenarios.
Develop and maintain comprehensive documentation on database connection pool configurations and best practices.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Update the database connection pool configuration to limit the maximum number of concurrent connections.
Conduct a thorough review of recent software updates to identify potential misconfigurations or issues.
Enhance monitoring system to provide real-time visibility into database performance and connection pool usage.
Implement automated alerting mechanisms to notify the operations team of any unusual database behavior.
Schedule regular capacity planning sessions to anticipate resource requirements and proactively scale infrastructure when needed.
